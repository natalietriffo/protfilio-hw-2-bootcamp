## Purpose
I learned and practiced how to create a portfolio with pictures, sections, forms, and more. Employers and other can see my page and contact me if interested.

## Update#1
After finishing project one I updated my personal portfolio with a screenshot and links to the website. 

## Update 2
I changed up the styling to have a more professional feel as well as adding in my project two and a homework example.
